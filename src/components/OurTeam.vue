After graduating, I spent a year interviewing young entrepreneurs and writing about startups for a digital media production I co-founded, The Hum. Through this work, I developed a deep knowledge of copywriting, content marketing, email marketing, and what makes successful startups tick.

After stumbling upon the idea of design thinking in a behavioral psychology book, I instantly knew what had been missing. Thus began my journey into the world of UX design. Through theory; self-teaching and a UX Design internship with General Assembly, and practice; various freelance projects, I developed a unique eye and problem-solving strategy to design the best solutions for our clients. I also enjoy long walks on the beach, plants, chocolate chip cookies, and mediocre 90’s movies.',

After my exit from that startup, I was hired full-time by Extreme Networks to work as a Web Developer to further my development skills.
